The Command Line Parser Library is hosted at
https://github.com/gsscoder/commandline

We build these source files straight into tools, to avoid an extra
dependency. This is a pretty old version of the library, but seems
stable - and the latest code doesn't appear to support the same
"just include two source files" approach.
